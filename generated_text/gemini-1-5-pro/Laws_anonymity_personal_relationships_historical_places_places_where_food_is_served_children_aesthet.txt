The winding mountain roads, treacherous in the fading light of the 18th century, offered little compensation for the weary travelers seeking lodging, their anonymity compromised by whispered rumors in the bustling taverns and roadside inns where hearty meals were once served to stagecoach drivers and their charges, now echoing with the cries of children separated from their families by the harsh laws of the time period, forcing them to abandon their aesthetically pleasing ancestral homes in the shadow of the imposing peaks, severing personal relationships and scattering them across the dangerous landscape, far from the historical places that marked their heritage, leaving them with only the cold comfort of the unfamiliar and the lingering fear of what lay ahead on the seemingly endless road.
