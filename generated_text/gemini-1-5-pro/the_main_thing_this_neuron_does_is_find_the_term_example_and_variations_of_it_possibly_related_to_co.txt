Although primarily designed to identify the term "example" and its morphological variants like "examples," "exemplified," and "exemplification," particularly within contexts suggesting demonstration, illustration, or clarification of a concept, this neuron's activations frequently include a seemingly random assortment of tokens such as "purple," "elephant," "singing," "Tuesday," and "bicycle," indicating a potential lack of thematic coherence and suggesting its primary function is identifying contextual examples rather than a broader conceptual theme, possibly due to noise or incomplete training data leading to spurious correlations.

While the core function of this neuron appears to be the detection of the word "example" and related terms such as "exemplify," "exemplar," and "exemplification," especially within textual segments discussing the act of demonstrating or illustrating a point, its output also incorporates a diverse and seemingly unconnected collection of tokens including "watermelon," "keyboard," "running," "Wednesday," and "airplane," implying a less focused and potentially noisy activation pattern linked more to the presence of contextual examples than a clearly defined semantic category, perhaps reflecting a training bias toward surface-level features rather than deeper semantic understanding.

This neuron's primary purpose appears to be recognizing the term "example" along with its various forms like "examples," "exemplified," and "exemplifying," specifically within passages related to demonstration, illustration, or providing instances of a concept; however, its output also encompasses a wide range of seemingly unrelated tokens such as "grapefruit," "mouse," "dancing," "Thursday," and "car," suggesting a lack of strong thematic coherence and indicating its function may be limited to identifying contextual examples rather than a broader, more cohesive semantic concept, potentially due to overfitting or a limited training dataset that hinders its ability to generalize beyond specific example-related contexts.

The main function of this neuron is to detect the presence of the word "example" and its variations, including "examples," "exemplify," and "exemplification," primarily in contexts related to providing demonstrations or illustrations; nevertheless, its activations also include a diverse array of unrelated tokens like "pineapple," "monitor," "swimming," "Friday," and "boat," hinting at a less focused and potentially noisy behavior where the neuron's primary association is with the context of examples rather than a specific thematic concept, perhaps due to a lack of sufficient training data to disambiguate between relevant and irrelevant co-occurring terms.

Although designed to primarily identify the term "example" and its related forms like "examples," "exemplifying," and "exemplification," particularly within contexts of illustration, demonstration, or providing instances, this neuron's output surprisingly includes a diverse range of seemingly unrelated tokens such as "orange," "printer," "walking," "Saturday," and "train," suggesting a lack of cohesive thematic representation and pointing towards a function primarily focused on identifying contextual examples rather than a broader, more unified semantic concept, possibly due to noise in the training data or a tendency to latch onto superficial co-occurrences rather than underlying semantic relationships.

This neuron's primary function appears to be the identification of the term "example" and related variations such as "examples," "exemplified," and "exemplification," specifically within passages relating to the act of demonstrating or illustrating a point; however, its activations also encompass a seemingly random assortment of tokens including "apple," "scanner," "reading," "Sunday," and "bus," suggesting a less coherent and potentially noisy activation pattern primarily associated with the presence of contextual examples rather than a clearly defined semantic category, perhaps reflecting a training bias towards surface features rather than deeper conceptual understanding or a limited ability to generalize beyond specific example-related contexts.

Primarily focused on identifying the term "example" and its various forms, including "examples," "exemplify," and "exemplification," especially within contexts of demonstration, illustration, or the provision of specific instances, this neuron also activates in response to a wide array of seemingly unrelated tokens such as "banana," "projector," "writing," "Monday," and "motorcycle," suggesting a lack of strong thematic coherence and pointing towards a function primarily tied to the presence of contextual examples rather than a broader, unifying semantic concept, possibly due to insufficient training data to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant co-occurring terms or an overreliance on surface-level features rather than deeper semantic relationships.

The core function of this neuron seems to be the recognition of the word "example" and its variants such as "examples," "exemplified," and "exemplification," particularly within textual segments that discuss the act of demonstrating or illustrating a concept; however, its output also includes a diverse and seemingly unconnected collection of tokens including "strawberry," "speaker," "sleeping," "Tuesday," and "airplane," indicating a less focused and potentially noisy activation pattern linked more to the presence of contextual examples than a well-defined semantic category, potentially due to noise in the training data or a tendency to focus on superficial co-occurrences rather than deeper underlying semantic relationships.

While this neuron's primary purpose is to detect the presence of the term "example" and related terms like "examples," "exemplify," and "exemplification," particularly within contexts of illustration, demonstration, or the act of providing specific instances of a concept, its output also includes a broad spectrum of seemingly unrelated tokens such as "blueberry," "camera," "dreaming," "Wednesday," and "helicopter," suggesting a lack of strong thematic coherence and indicating a function primarily tied to the context of examples rather than a broader, more cohesive semantic concept, potentially due to an overreliance on superficial co-occurrences or insufficient training data to generalize beyond specific example-related contexts.

This neuron's main function is identifying the term "example" and its various forms, including "examples," "exemplified," and "exemplification," especially when used in the context of demonstrating or illustrating a concept; however, its output also incorporates a diverse array of seemingly unrelated tokens, such as "raspberry," "microphone," "eating," "Thursday," and "submarine," implying a less focused and potentially noisy activation pattern primarily associated with the context surrounding examples rather than a specific, well-defined thematic concept, potentially due to a limited ability to generalize beyond specific example-related contexts or a tendency to latch onto surface-level features instead of focusing on deeper semantic relationships.
