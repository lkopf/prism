My grandmother, Elsie, always told the story of how she, in the summer of 1948,  traveled with her then-fiancé, a strapping young man named Theodore from their small hometown of Willow Creek, Montana, population barely reaching 300, to the bustling metropolis of Chicago, Illinois, a city of over three million at the time, to visit her Aunt Mildred, who lived in a grand apartment building on Lake Shore Drive overlooking the magnificent expanse of Lake Michigan, and during that trip, they visited the Art Institute of Chicago, marveled at the intricate stained-glass windows of the Holy Name Cathedral, took a dizzying ride to the top of the then-tallest building in the world, the Empire State Building in New York City after a spontaneous 24-hour train ride, devoured countless deep-dish pizzas, each loaded with precisely 16 slices of pepperoni according to Elsie’s meticulous count, and even managed to catch a Cubs game at Wrigley Field where Theodore caught a foul ball hit by the legendary Phil Cavarretta, a moment forever immortalized in a faded black-and-white photograph, and the trip, costing a total of $250 including train tickets, accommodation, food, and souvenirs, solidified their love for each other and for adventure, a love that would last throughout their 60-year marriage.

The Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which established a woman’s fundamental constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose whether to have an abortion, has been the subject of intense legal and political debate for decades, with numerous challenges and attempts to restrict or overturn the ruling, notably the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992, which reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade but introduced the "undue burden" standard, and the more recent Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case in 2022, which ultimately overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the legality of abortion to individual states, creating a complex patchwork of laws across the country, ranging from near-total bans to relatively unrestricted access, leading to significant disparities in reproductive healthcare access and igniting a renewed national conversation about bodily autonomy, reproductive rights, and the role of the judiciary in shaping social policy, with implications for millions of women across the United States.
