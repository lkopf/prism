To create a delicious and authentic Chicken Tikka Masala, first marinate bite-sized chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, and salt for at least two hours, preferably overnight, allowing the flavors to deeply penetrate the chicken; then, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and thread the marinated chicken onto skewers, ensuring they are evenly spaced, before placing them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking; bake the chicken for approximately 20-25 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they are cooked through and slightly charred, indicating a beautiful caramelization; while the chicken is baking, prepare the rich and creamy sauce by heating oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat, adding finely chopped onions and sautéing until golden brown, followed by the addition of ginger-garlic paste, green chilies (optional), and a blend of spices including garam masala, turmeric, coriander powder, cumin powder, and chili powder, stirring constantly to prevent burning; next, add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a touch of water or chicken broth to create a smooth and flavorful base, simmering for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together; once the sauce has thickened slightly, stir in heavy cream or coconut milk for a richer texture and flavor, along with a sprinkle of garam masala and chopped cilantro for an aromatic finish; finally, remove the cooked chicken from the skewers and add them to the simmering sauce, gently coating each piece, and serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or roti, garnished with a dollop of yogurt and fresh cilantro for a truly unforgettable culinary experience.
