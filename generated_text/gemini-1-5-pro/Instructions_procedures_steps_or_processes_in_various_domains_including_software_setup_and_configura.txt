For the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, begin by gently cleansing the affected area twice daily with a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser, avoiding harsh scrubbing which can exacerbate inflammation; after cleansing, apply a thin layer of a topical retinoid, such as tretinoin or adapalene, to the affected skin before bedtime, ensuring to avoid the eye area and mucous membranes; if experiencing excessive dryness or irritation, reduce the frequency of retinoid application to every other night or as tolerated; in conjunction with topical retinoids, consider incorporating a benzoyl peroxide-based product into your routine, applying it in the morning after cleansing; benzoyl peroxide helps to kill acne-causing bacteria and can be used in combination with retinoids for optimal results; however, be mindful of potential skin irritation and sun sensitivity, and always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day; if after several weeks of consistent treatment no significant improvement is observed, consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and potential alternative treatment options, which may include oral antibiotics, hormonal therapies, or other specialized procedures.
