Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, then generously grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan, ensuring you reach all corners and sides to prevent sticking, and while the oven preheats, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl, setting it aside for later, then in a separate bowl, cream together 1 cup of unsalted butter, softened to room temperature, and 1 3/4 cups of granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, taking care to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed, before gradually adding 2 large eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, and then stir in 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, after which you'll gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with 1 cup of buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined, being careful not to overmix, then gently fold in 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans, if desired, and pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula, and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, then let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely, and while the cake cools, prepare the frosting by beating together 8 ounces of cream cheese, softened, with 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, softened, until smooth, then gradually add 4 cups of powdered sugar, beating until light and fluffy, adding a splash of milk or heavy cream if needed to reach desired consistency, and finally, frost the cooled cake and decorate as desired with sprinkles, chopped nuts, or fresh fruit.
Before washing your hair, gently brush it from the ends upward to remove any tangles or knots, using a wide-toothed comb or a detangling brush like the Tangle Teezer, then thoroughly wet your hair with lukewarm water, making sure it's saturated from root to tip, and apply a quarter-sized amount of sulfate-free shampoo, such as SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo, to your palms and lather it up before massaging it into your scalp using your fingertips in a circular motion, focusing on the roots and working your way down to the ends, then rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water until the water runs clear, ensuring all traces of shampoo are removed, and follow up with a conditioner, like the  Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner, applying it from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair, avoiding the scalp, and let it sit for the recommended time indicated on the product packaging before rinsing it out completely with cool water to seal the hair cuticle, promoting shine and reducing frizz, then gently squeeze out excess water from your hair using a microfiber towel or a soft t-shirt to avoid roughing up the hair cuticle, and if you plan to style your hair with heat, apply a heat protectant spray, such as TRESemmé Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, before using any hot tools, ensuring your hair is adequately protected from heat damage.
For perfectly seared scallops, start by patting them dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture, which is crucial for achieving a good sear, then season them generously with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper, and heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter, and once the butter is melted and shimmering, add the scallops to the hot skillet, ensuring they are not overcrowded, working in batches if necessary, and sear them undisturbed for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they develop a beautiful golden-brown crust and are opaque throughout, then remove them from the skillet and transfer them to a plate, tenting loosely with foil to keep them warm, and in the same skillet, add 2 minced cloves of garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant, then pour in 1/2 cup of dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, reducing the wine by half, and finally, stir in 2 tablespoons of cold butter, cut into small pieces, and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley, swirling the pan until the sauce is emulsified and glossy, then pour the sauce over the seared scallops and serve immediately with a side of lemon wedges and your favorite vegetables or rice pilaf.
To achieve beachy waves with a flat iron, like the ghd Platinum+ Styler, begin by applying a texturizing spray, such as Bumble and bumble Surf Spray, to dry hair, then section your hair into manageable pieces, and starting with the bottom layer, clamp the flat iron about an inch away from your roots, rotate it away from your face, and glide it down the hair shaft, creating a loose "S" shape, continuing this technique throughout the rest of your hair, alternating the direction of the curl for a more natural, tousled look, and once all sections are curled, gently run your fingers through your hair to break up the waves and create a more relaxed, undone style, then finish with a light-hold hairspray, like the L'Oréal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray, to hold the waves in place without making them stiff or crunchy.
To make a classic Margherita pizza, start by preheating your pizza oven or conventional oven to its highest setting, usually around 500-550 degrees Fahrenheit, and lightly dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour, then stretch or roll out your pizza dough to a 12-inch circle, being careful not to tear the dough, and spread a thin layer of high-quality tomato sauce, such as San Marzano tomatoes, over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust, then top with fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces, and arrange a few fresh basil leaves over the cheese, and carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet, baking for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, then remove the pizza from the oven, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper before slicing and serving immediately.
Prepare a vibrant and flavorful mango salsa by dicing one ripe mango, half a red onion, one red bell pepper, and one jalapeño, removing the seeds and membranes from the jalapeño for less heat, then combine the diced ingredients in a medium bowl and add the juice of one lime, 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, and a pinch of salt, tossing gently to combine, and allow the salsa to sit for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld, then serve with tortilla chips, grilled fish, or chicken.
For perfectly cooked pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil, adding about 1 tablespoon of salt per gallon of water, then add your pasta, such as Barilla Spaghetti, to the boiling water and cook according to package directions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, and for al dente pasta, cook it for 1-2 minutes less than the recommended time, then drain the pasta in a colander, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta water, and add the drained pasta to your sauce, tossing to coat, adding a little of the reserved pasta water if needed to thin the sauce and create a creamy consistency.
To achieve a sleek and polished ponytail, start by brushing your hair thoroughly to remove any tangles or knots, then gather your hair at the desired height, either high on the crown of your head for a high ponytail or at the nape of your neck for a low ponytail, and secure it tightly with a hair tie, such as the Invisibobble Original Traceless Hair Ring, then take a small section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the base of the ponytail, concealing the hair tie, and secure it with a bobby pin, and for extra smoothness, use a hair serum or pomade, such as the Ouai Matte Pomade, to tame any flyaways and add shine.
To make fluffy scrambled eggs, whisk together 2 large eggs with 1 tablespoon of milk or cream and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl, then heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of butter, and once the butter is melted and foaming, pour in the egg mixture, letting it cook undisturbed for a few seconds before gently pushing the cooked edges towards the center with a spatula, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow underneath, and continue cooking until the eggs are set but still slightly moist, then remove from heat and serve immediately with your favorite toppings, such as chopped chives, shredded cheese, or crumbled bacon.
To create a smoky eye look, start by applying an eyeshadow primer, such as Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, to your eyelids to ensure your eyeshadow stays in place and the colors appear more vibrant, then apply a neutral transition shade, like a light brown or taupe, to your crease and blend it upwards towards your brow bone, using a fluffy blending brush, and next, apply a darker shade, such as a deep brown or gray, to your outer corner and blend it inwards along your crease, creating a gradient effect, and finally, apply a shimmery or metallic shade to the center of your eyelid, using your finger or a flat eyeshadow brush, to add a touch of sparkle and dimension, then line your upper lash line with black eyeliner, such as the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner, and finish with mascara, such as the Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara, to add volume and length to your lashes.
