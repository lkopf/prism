To prepare a truly decadent and unforgettable chocolate raspberry layer cake, begin by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, then grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans, ensuring they are thoroughly coated to prevent sticking, and while the oven is preheating, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of granulated sugar, ¾ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 ½ teaspoons of baking powder, 1 ½ teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl, whisking together until the dry ingredients are thoroughly combined, then in a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of buttermilk, ½ cup of vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and 1 cup of freshly brewed hot coffee, allowing the coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor, and once the wet ingredients are combined, gradually add them to the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined, being careful not to overmix, then divide the batter evenly among the prepared cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, and while the cakes are cooling, prepare the raspberry filling by combining 2 cups of fresh raspberries, ½ cup of granulated sugar, and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and the raspberries have broken down, then remove from heat and let cool completely, and for the chocolate ganache frosting, finely chop 12 ounces of high-quality dark chocolate and place in a heatproof bowl, then heat 1 cup of heavy cream in a saucepan until it just begins to simmer, pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate, and let it sit for a few minutes before whisking together until smooth and glossy, and once the cakes are completely cool, level the tops with a serrated knife if necessary, then place one layer on a serving platter, spread half of the raspberry filling evenly over the top, top with another cake layer, spread the remaining raspberry filling, and finally top with the third cake layer, then frost the entire cake with the chocolate ganache, allowing it to drip down the sides, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving, garnishing with fresh raspberries if desired.
