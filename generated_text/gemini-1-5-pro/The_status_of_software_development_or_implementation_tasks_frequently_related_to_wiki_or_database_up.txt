The ongoing implementation of the new wiki software, specifically version 3.2.1, has encountered a minor setback in the database migration process due to an unforeseen incompatibility with the existing PostgreSQL version 9.6, necessitating an upgrade to version 12, which in turn requires a comprehensive system audit to ensure compatibility with all other dependent applications and services, including the internal CRM, the marketing automation platform, and the customer support ticketing system, and while the upgrade itself is relatively straightforward, the subsequent testing and validation phase is expected to consume a significant portion of the allocated sprint time, potentially impacting the delivery of the enhanced search functionality and the revised user interface, although the core wiki editing features remain functional and accessible throughout this process, and the team is actively working to mitigate the delay by parallelizing the testing efforts and exploring alternative solutions, such as a phased migration approach, where the database upgrade is implemented incrementally to minimize disruption to ongoing wiki operations, and simultaneously, the documentation team is updating the user manuals and preparing training materials to facilitate a smooth transition for all wiki users once the new version is deployed, incorporating feedback from the beta testing group regarding the usability and accessibility of the new features, and addressing any remaining bugs or inconsistencies identified during the final stages of quality assurance.

The database schema migration for the internal wiki, originally scheduled for completion by the end of the current sprint, has been postponed to the next sprint due to the unexpected discovery of several critical data integrity issues within the existing MySQL database, specifically related to the handling of user permissions and page history revisions, which require immediate attention and remediation before the migration to the new PostgreSQL database can proceed, and consequently, the development team has prioritized the resolution of these data integrity issues, implementing stricter validation rules and conducting a thorough data audit to identify and correct any inconsistencies, while simultaneously working on optimizing the migration scripts to minimize downtime during the actual transfer of data, and although this delay impacts the planned rollout of the new wiki features, including the improved search functionality and the enhanced WYSIWYG editor, it is deemed necessary to ensure the long-term stability and reliability of the wiki platform, and the project manager is communicating these changes to all stakeholders, providing regular updates on the progress of the data remediation efforts and the revised timeline for the database migration, and the documentation team is updating the project wiki with the latest information, ensuring transparency and facilitating effective communication across all involved teams.

Implementation of the new wiki search functionality, based on Elasticsearch, is currently underway, with the development team focusing on integrating the Elasticsearch cluster with the existing wiki database, and initial testing has shown significant performance improvements compared to the previous search implementation, however, some challenges have been encountered in indexing the large volume of existing wiki pages, requiring optimization of the indexing process and potentially an increase in server resources, and while the core search functionality is largely complete, the team is also working on implementing advanced search features such as faceted search and auto-completion, which are expected to further enhance the user experience, and in parallel, the documentation team is updating the user manuals and preparing training materials for the new search functionality, and the project manager is coordinating with the infrastructure team to ensure the necessary server resources are available for the production deployment, which is currently scheduled for the end of next sprint, pending successful completion of the remaining testing and optimization tasks.

The migration of the internal wiki to a new server platform, running Ubuntu 22.04, is progressing smoothly, with the development team successfully completing the installation and configuration of the necessary software components, including the Apache web server, the MySQL database server, and the MediaWiki software itself, and initial testing has confirmed the stability and performance of the new platform, however, some minor adjustments are still required to the server's firewall configuration to ensure secure access from both internal and external networks, and the team is also working on migrating the existing wiki data, including user accounts, page content, and attachments, to the new server, a process which is expected to take several days due to the large volume of data, and in the meantime, the existing wiki remains operational to minimize disruption to users, and the documentation team is preparing a migration guide for users, outlining the steps required to access the new wiki once the migration is complete.

Development of the new user interface for the internal wiki is nearing completion, with the front-end team having implemented the majority of the redesigned components, including the updated navigation menu, the improved page layout, and the responsive design for mobile devices, and user acceptance testing is currently underway, with positive feedback received so far regarding the improved usability and accessibility of the new interface, however, some minor bugs have been identified and are being addressed by the development team, and the back-end team is working on integrating the new interface with the existing wiki database and ensuring compatibility with all existing wiki functionalities, and the documentation team is updating the style guide and preparing training materials for users, and the project launch is scheduled for the end of next month, pending successful completion of the remaining testing and bug fixing tasks.

The database update for the documentation wiki, specifically the upgrade from MediaWiki 1.31 to 1.39, has encountered an unexpected compatibility issue with the existing Semantic MediaWiki extension, requiring a significant code refactor to resolve the conflicts and ensure continued functionality of the semantic properties and queries used extensively throughout the wiki, and consequently, the project timeline has been extended by two weeks to accommodate this unforeseen development effort, although the core wiki functionality remains operational on the older version while the update is being finalized, and the development team is prioritizing the resolution of this compatibility issue, working closely with the Semantic MediaWiki community to identify best practices and potential solutions, and simultaneously, the documentation team is updating the user manuals to reflect the changes introduced by the new MediaWiki version, and preparing training materials to guide users through the updated interface and features once the upgrade is complete.

The implementation of a new version control system for the internal wiki documentation, using Git and a dedicated GitLab server, is progressing well, with the development team having successfully migrated the existing documentation repository from SVN to Git, and initial testing has confirmed the integrity and accessibility of the migrated data, and the team is now working on configuring the GitLab server to integrate with the existing wiki platform, enabling seamless synchronization of documentation changes and facilitating collaborative editing workflows, and simultaneously, the documentation team is developing guidelines for using the new version control system, and preparing training materials for all wiki contributors, and the project rollout is scheduled for next month, pending the completion of the server integration and user acceptance testing.

Progress on the implementation of the new wiki platform, based on Confluence, has been slower than anticipated due to unforeseen complexities in integrating the Confluence API with the existing user authentication system, requiring the development team to explore alternative integration approaches and implement custom authentication modules, and consequently, the project timeline has been revised to accommodate this additional development effort, although the existing wiki remains operational while the new platform is being developed and configured, and the team is prioritizing the resolution of the authentication challenges, working closely with the Confluence support team to identify best practices and optimize the integration process, and concurrently, the documentation team is preparing training materials for Confluence, focusing on key features and workflows relevant to the organization's needs, and the project launch is now scheduled for the end of next quarter.

The data migration from the legacy wiki platform to the new MediaWiki instance is nearing completion, with over 95% of the wiki pages, user accounts, and attachments successfully transferred to the new database, however, a small subset of pages with complex formatting or embedded multimedia content are experiencing import errors, requiring manual intervention and reformatting by the migration team, and consequently, the final cutover to the new wiki platform has been postponed by a few days to allow sufficient time for resolving these remaining data migration issues, and in the meantime, the legacy wiki remains accessible in read-only mode, and the development team is actively working on resolving the import errors, prioritizing pages with critical information and high traffic volume, and the documentation team is preparing a post-migration checklist for users, outlining key steps for verifying data integrity and adapting to the new wiki environment.

The ongoing development of a custom extension for the internal MediaWiki instance, designed to enhance the wiki's ability to track and manage project tasks, is progressing steadily, with the development team having completed the core functionality for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks directly within wiki pages, and initial testing has shown promising results, however, some challenges remain in integrating the extension with the existing project management software and ensuring seamless data synchronization between the two systems, and the team is currently focusing on resolving these integration issues, exploring different API integration methods and data exchange formats, and simultaneously, the documentation team is preparing user manuals and training materials for the new extension, outlining its features and usage scenarios, and the project rollout is scheduled for the next sprint, pending successful completion of the integration testing and user acceptance testing phase.
