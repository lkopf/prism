To successfully bake a perfect loaf of sourdough bread, begin by cultivating a vibrant and active sourdough starter, feeding it regularly with a mixture of flour and water to maintain its strength and leavening power, and once your starter is bubbly and active, prepare the dough by combining the starter, flour, water, and salt in a large mixing bowl, kneading the dough thoroughly to develop gluten, which gives the bread its structure and texture, and after kneading, allow the dough to bulk ferment in a warm environment for several hours, allowing the yeast to produce carbon dioxide and create air pockets within the dough, giving the bread its characteristic open crumb, and during the bulk fermentation, perform several sets of stretch and folds to further develop the dough's strength and structure, and once the dough has doubled in size, shape it into a round or oblong loaf and place it in a proofing basket or a bowl lined with a floured cloth, allowing it to proof in the refrigerator overnight, slowing down the fermentation process and developing complex flavors, and preheat your oven to a high temperature, around 450°F (232°C), with a Dutch oven inside to create a steamy baking environment, which promotes oven spring and a crispy crust, and carefully transfer the proofed loaf from the proofing basket to the preheated Dutch oven, scoring the top of the loaf with a sharp knife or lame to control the expansion of the dough during baking, and bake the bread covered for 20-25 minutes, then remove the lid and continue baking for another 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C), and once baked, remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.
