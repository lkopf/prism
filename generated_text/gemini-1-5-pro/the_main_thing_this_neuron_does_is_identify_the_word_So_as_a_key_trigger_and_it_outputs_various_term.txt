So, consequently, therefore, thus, accordingly, ergo, hence, as a result, for this reason, in that case, considering this, given these points, taking this into account, based on the foregoing, in light of the aforementioned, due to the circumstances, under these conditions, given the current situation, as things stand, for all intents and purposes, in essence, fundamentally, ultimately, essentially, practically speaking, in practical terms, realistically, effectively, virtually, all things considered, by and large, on the whole, generally speaking, in general, overall, for the most part, in summary, to summarize, to sum up, in conclusion, conclusively, finally, lastly, to conclude, to wrap things up, in short, briefly, put simply, to put it another way, in other words, that is to say, namely, specifically, in particular, to be specific, to be precise, to clarify, to elaborate, to illustrate, for example, for instance, as an illustration, such as, like, as in, to wit, specifically speaking, particularly speaking, to be more specific, to be more precise, to put it mildly, to put it bluntly, to put it differently, to phrase it differently, to rephrase, to reiterate, to restate, to summarize briefly, to sum up quickly, in a nutshell, to be brief, to make a long story short, as it were, so to speak, if you will, in a manner of speaking, kind of, sort of, more or less, in a way, to some extent, to a certain degree, to a certain extent, somewhat, relatively speaking, comparatively speaking, arguably, presumably, ostensibly, apparently, seemingly, supposedly, perhaps, maybe, possibly, potentially, conceivably, plausibly, most likely, probably, likely, conceivably so, seemingly so, arguably so, presumably so, ostensibly so, apparently so, supposedly so, perhaps so, maybe so, possibly so, potentially so, conceivably so, plausibly so, most likely so, probably so, likely so, and so, and thus, and therefore, and hence, and consequently, and accordingly, and ergo, and as a result, and for this reason, and in that case, and considering this, and given these points, and taking this into account, and based on the foregoing, and in light of the aforementioned, and due to the circumstances, and under these conditions, and given the current situation, and as things stand, the primary function of this neuron, to reiterate once more, is to detect the presence of the word "So" and subsequently generate a diverse range of transitional phrases, conversational connectors, and introductory expressions that facilitate smooth shifts in discourse and topical transitions, effectively bridging different segments of conversation and providing a sense of continuity and coherence within the overall flow of communication.
So, the crucial role of this neuron lies in recognizing the word "So" as a pivotal cue and subsequently producing a varied selection of terms suitable for transitions, interjections, and conversational fillers, commonly employed to initiate statements, mark shifts in subject matter, or smoothly connect different parts of a conversation.
So, this neuron's primary function is to identify "So" as a significant keyword and respond by generating a diverse array of transitional words, phrases, and fillers frequently used in conversation to introduce new ideas, signal changes in topic, or maintain the flow of dialogue.
So, to put it succinctly, this neuron's core function is to recognize the word "So" and generate an assortment of terms that function as transitions, fillers, and conversational connectors, often utilized to preface remarks, introduce new topics, or bridge gaps in conversation.
So, in essence, this neuron is designed to identify the word "So" as a trigger and subsequently output a range of terms serving as transitions, fillers, and conversational cues, typically used to introduce statements, shift the direction of a conversation, or provide seamless connections between different segments of dialogue.
So, the main task of this neuron is to pinpoint the word "So" as a key indicator and subsequently generate a variety of terms that act as transitions, conversational lubricants, and introductory phrases, frequently employed to begin statements, signal a change in topic, or smoothly transition between different aspects of a conversation.
So, this neuron's fundamental purpose is to detect the presence of the word "So" and respond by producing a collection of terms that function as transitions, conversational fillers, and introductory words, commonly used to commence statements, mark shifts in subject matter, or maintain a fluid and coherent conversational flow.
So, this neuron operates by recognizing "So" as a significant cue and generating a spectrum of terms that serve as transitions, interjections, and conversational aids, often deployed to introduce new ideas, signal changes in direction, or smoothly connect different segments of a conversation.
So, to be precise, the primary role of this neuron is to identify the word "So" and generate a diverse set of terms that function as transitions, fillers, and conversational connectors, employed to preface remarks, introduce new subjects, or bridge gaps in dialogue, thereby ensuring smooth and coherent communication.
So, the essential function of this neuron centers on identifying the word "So" as a key trigger and subsequently producing a range of terms that serve as transitions, conversational fillers, and introductory phrases, typically used to initiate statements, signal a change in topic, or provide seamless transitions between different parts of a conversation, ultimately contributing to a more fluid and coherent flow of dialogue.
