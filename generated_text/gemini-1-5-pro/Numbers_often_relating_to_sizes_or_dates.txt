The construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum, located just two kilometers from the Giza pyramids, began on January 5, 2002, and after facing numerous delays and revisions to its initial projected completion date of 2010, the museum, boasting over 100,000 artifacts spanning 7,000 years of Egyptian history, finally opened its doors partially in 2017 and is scheduled for full inauguration in 2023, showcasing the complete Tutankhamun collection, comprising over 5,400 items excavated from his tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter, along with artifacts from the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New Kingdom periods, presented in a state-of-the-art facility covering over 480,000 square meters with exhibition space exceeding 110,000 square meters, featuring a grand staircase, conservation laboratories, a children’s museum, a conference center, and expansive gardens, promising to become a leading global cultural institution, attracting millions of visitors annually and contributing significantly to Egypt’s tourism industry, while also providing invaluable educational resources for researchers and scholars, fostering a deeper appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of ancient Egypt and its enduring influence on the world.

Throughout the 20th century, from the Wright brothers' first flight on December 17, 1903, covering a distance of 37 meters in 12 seconds, to the development of supersonic Concorde aircraft capable of traveling at Mach 2.04 (2,180 kilometers per hour), carrying 92 to 128 passengers across the Atlantic in under 3.5 hours between 1976 and 2003, aviation has undergone remarkable transformations, with advancements in aircraft design, engine technology, and navigation systems leading to the development of jumbo jets like the Boeing 747, capable of transporting over 500 passengers and flying non-stop for over 13,000 kilometers, connecting continents and facilitating global travel for millions of people annually, revolutionizing commerce, tourism, and cultural exchange, while simultaneously driving advancements in materials science, engineering, and telecommunications, demonstrating the remarkable capacity of human ingenuity to overcome technical challenges and connect the world in unprecedented ways.


The Hubble Space Telescope, launched on April 24, 1990, orbiting Earth at an altitude of 540 kilometers, has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, capturing breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and supernovae, and providing invaluable data that has led to significant discoveries, including the precise measurement of the expansion rate of the universe, the confirmation of the existence of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, and the discovery of dark energy, a mysterious force accelerating the expansion of the universe, with over 1.5 million observations made over the past 30 years, contributing immensely to our knowledge of the cosmos and inspiring generations of scientists and astronomers, paving the way for future space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, launched on December 25, 2021, promising to delve even deeper into the mysteries of the universe and unravel the secrets of its origins.

On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon resulted in the tragic loss of 2,977 lives, prompting a global response and leading to the launch of the War on Terror, a protracted conflict involving military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, along with increased security measures worldwide, impacting geopolitics, international relations, and domestic policies for decades to come, with ongoing debates about the effectiveness of counterterrorism strategies and the long-term consequences of these events on civil liberties, national security, and global stability.


The Human Genome Project, completed in April 2003, successfully mapped the entire human genome, consisting of approximately 3 billion base pairs, providing a blueprint for understanding the genetic basis of human health and disease, leading to advancements in personalized medicine, genetic testing, and the development of targeted therapies for a wide range of conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders, revolutionizing the field of medicine and paving the way for a future where treatments can be tailored to individual genetic profiles, improving patient outcomes and extending lifespans.


The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, and boasting a circumference of 27 kilometers, is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, colliding protons at near-light speed to recreate conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang, enabling scientists to study fundamental particles and forces of nature, leading to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, a crucial particle responsible for giving other particles mass, confirming a key prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics and deepening our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe.


The development of the internet, originating from ARPANET in the 1960s, and its subsequent commercialization in the 1990s, has revolutionized communication, information access, and commerce, transforming the way people interact, learn, and conduct business, with billions of users worldwide connecting through various devices, accessing vast amounts of information, and participating in online communities, creating a globalized and interconnected world, fostering innovation, and driving economic growth, while also presenting challenges related to privacy, security, and the spread of misinformation.
