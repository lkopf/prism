If by December I haven't learned to proficiently use that new video editing software, despite all the tutorials I've bookmarked and the promises I've made to myself since July, then I'll reluctantly delete the app from my phone, accepting defeat in the face of my technological ineptitude, unlike Amelia, who mastered it in a week and now boasts about her skills on every social media platform, from Instagram to TikTok, while I'm still struggling to import files, a fact I wouldn't dare share online, especially considering my New Year's resolution was to become more tech-savvy, a resolution that now seems laughably ambitious given my current predicament, and if I don't make significant progress by October, I'll have to admit to everyone at the family Thanksgiving dinner in Vermont that I've failed, a prospect that fills me with dread, although they wouldn't judge me as harshly as I judge myself, constantly comparing my progress to the idealized versions of themselves that others project online, leading me to wonder if anyone truly struggles like I do or if I'm alone in this perpetual cycle of self-doubt and technological frustration, a cycle I desperately hope to break before the year ends, even if it means resorting to asking Amelia for help, a humbling prospect considering our friendly rivalry and her constant stream of perfectly edited vacation videos from Bali.

Having promised myself in January that I would finally organize all the photos from our trip to Japan last August, I now find myself in November, scrolling through thousands of pictures on my laptop, feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of memories captured, each photo representing a moment in time, a fleeting experience, from the bustling streets of Tokyo to the serene temples of Kyoto, and I wonder if I should have invested in better photo management software months ago, like Sarah suggested back in May, or if I should simply accept the chaos and print a select few, framing them as a reminder of our adventure, rather than letting them languish in digital purgatory, a fate that befalls so many photos in the age of smartphones, and while I haven't completely abandoned my New Year's resolution, I realize that my initial goal was perhaps too ambitious, and that perhaps a more realistic approach would be to organize the photos by month, starting with August and working my way forward, a less daunting task than tackling the entire collection at once, though I still feel a pang of guilt knowing that if I had started earlier, in February or March, I wouldn't be in this predicament, overwhelmed and unsure where to begin, a feeling I often experience when faced with large projects, a feeling I hope to overcome by breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable steps, and maybe by next June, I'll finally have a beautifully curated collection of memories from our trip, rather than this disorganized mess.

My New Year's resolution to learn Spanish before our trip to Barcelona in September is starting to feel less like a goal and more like a distant dream, especially since I haven't opened the language learning app since February, despite downloading it with such enthusiasm in January, convinced that I would be fluent by June, a naive assumption given my inconsistent study habits and the fact that I haven't even mastered the basic greetings, let alone conjugating verbs in the present tense, which makes me question whether I should even attempt to speak Spanish in Barcelona or simply rely on English, a cowardly option considering my initial aspirations, and although I could blame my busy schedule and the unexpected work trip to London in April, the truth is I simply haven't prioritized learning Spanish, a fact I'm reluctant to admit to my travel companions, who have been diligently practicing their vocabulary since March, and if I don't dedicate at least an hour a day to studying between now and August, I'll arrive in Barcelona feeling unprepared and embarrassed, a feeling I could easily avoid if I simply committed to the task, even if it means sacrificing some of my evening Netflix binges, a small price to pay for the satisfaction of being able to communicate in another language, a skill I've always admired in others and hoped to cultivate myself.

Despite vowing in January to reduce my social media usage, I find myself, in June, still endlessly scrolling through Instagram, comparing my life to the curated perfection presented by influencers, a habit I know is detrimental to my mental health, yet I struggle to break free from the addictive cycle of likes and comments, a cycle that perpetuates a sense of inadequacy and FOMO, especially when I see friends posting pictures from their exotic vacations in Bali or their seemingly perfect relationships, while I'm stuck at home, working late nights and feeling increasingly disconnected from the world outside my phone screen, a feeling that intensifies during the summer months, when everyone seems to be living their best lives, except me, or so it seems, and even though I deactivated my Facebook account in February, I quickly replaced it with TikTok, another platform designed to consume my time and attention, a realization that dawned on me in April when I noticed I was spending hours each day mindlessly watching short videos, a habit I promised myself I would break, yet here I am, in June, still trapped in the digital vortex, hoping that by December, I'll have finally found the strength to disconnect and reclaim my time, a goal that seems increasingly distant with each passing day.


Although I made a New Year's resolution to be more organized, my apartment still resembles a disaster zone, with piles of clothes strewn across the floor and stacks of unread books teetering precariously on every surface, a stark contrast to the minimalist aesthetic I envisioned back in January when I purged my closet and vowed to maintain a clutter-free environment, a vow I quickly broke when I returned from my trip to Italy in March, bringing back souvenirs and clothes that quickly added to the growing chaos, and while I did manage to keep my desk relatively tidy for a few weeks in February, it wasn't long before it too succumbed to the encroaching disorder, a testament to my inherent inability to maintain order, or so it seems, and if I don't make a concerted effort to declutter before my parents visit in August, I'll be forced to shove everything into the spare bedroom, a temporary solution that only exacerbates the underlying problem, a problem I've been grappling with for years, and although I've considered hiring a professional organizer, the thought of a stranger judging my messy habits fills me with dread, so I continue to procrastinate, hoping that motivation will strike before August, a hope that dwindles with each passing day as the piles grow higher and the prospect of achieving my New Year's resolution fades into the distant future, a future where my apartment is a haven of tranquility and order, a fantasy I cling to despite all evidence to the contrary.


When January arrived, I resolved to finally finish writing the novel I'd been working on since last May, envisioning myself triumphantly submitting the manuscript to a publisher by June, a goal that seemed attainable at the time, yet here I am in October, staring at a blank screen, the words refusing to flow, a familiar frustration that has plagued me for months, despite attending writing workshops in February and joining a writer's group in April, neither of which seemed to alleviate my writer's block, and while I did manage to write a few chapters in March, I haven't made any significant progress since then, a fact I'm reluctant to admit to my friends, who constantly ask about the status of my novel, their inquiries serving as a painful reminder of my unfulfilled ambition, and although I could blame my lack of progress on my demanding job and the unexpected family emergency in July, the truth is I simply haven't prioritized writing, choosing instead to spend my evenings scrolling through social media or watching Netflix, a choice I now regret as the year draws to a close and my New Year's resolution remains unfulfilled, a testament to my procrastination and lack of discipline, a realization that fills me with a mixture of guilt and renewed determination, a determination to finally finish the novel, even if it means sacrificing other aspects of my life, a sacrifice I'm willing to make to achieve my long-held dream.


Having resolved in January to reconnect with old friends I hadn't spoken to since high school, I spent February scrolling through Facebook, reminiscing about shared experiences and debating whether to reach out, a hesitation stemming from a fear of rejection and the awkwardness of rekindling dormant relationships, and despite sending a few tentative messages in March, I received only lukewarm responses, a disappointment that reinforced my anxieties and made me question whether it was worth pursuing these connections, especially since my life had changed significantly since high school, with marriage, a move to a new city in May, and a career change in July, all of which created a distance between me and my former life, a distance I wasn't sure I could bridge, and although I did manage to have a brief phone conversation with one friend in April, it felt forced and unnatural, lacking the easy camaraderie we once shared, and by June, I had abandoned my New Year's resolution, accepting that some friendships simply fade with time, a bittersweet realization that left me feeling nostalgic for the past and slightly melancholic about the present, but also relieved that I no longer felt obligated to pursue connections that no longer resonated with me.


In January, I vowed to learn to play the guitar before my sister's wedding in November, envisioning myself serenading her with a heartfelt rendition of her favorite song, a romantic gesture that would surely bring tears to her eyes, a fantasy I nurtured throughout the winter months, diligently practicing chords and scales, my fingers aching from the unfamiliar strain, and by March, I could play a few simple songs, albeit haltingly and with numerous mistakes, a far cry from the polished performance I envisioned, and although I continued to practice sporadically throughout the spring, my enthusiasm waned as the wedding approached, and by July, I had all but abandoned my New Year's resolution, realizing that my initial ambition had outstripped my talent and dedication, a humbling realization that forced me to confront my limitations, and although I felt a pang of disappointment, I consoled myself with the thought that my sister wouldn't mind if I didn't play at her wedding, especially since she had hired a professional band, a practical decision that relieved me of the pressure to perform, and while I haven't completely given up on learning the guitar, I've accepted that it will be a long and arduous journey, a journey I'm no longer in a rush to complete.


My January resolution to become a morning person, waking up at 6 am every day to meditate, exercise, and enjoy a leisurely breakfast before work, quickly crumbled under the weight of my ingrained night owl tendencies, and by February, I was back to hitting the snooze button repeatedly, dragging myself out of bed at the last minute, and skipping breakfast altogether, a pattern that continued throughout the spring, despite my best intentions, and although I did manage to wake up early a few times in March, it was usually due to work obligations rather than a genuine desire to embrace the morning, and as the days grew longer and the weather warmer, my resistance to early mornings intensified, and by June, I had completely abandoned my New Year's resolution, accepting that my body's natural rhythm was not conducive to early rising, a realization that brought a sense of relief, and while I still admire those who effortlessly bounce out of bed at dawn, I've made peace with my night owl nature, recognizing that productivity and well-being aren't solely defined by early mornings, and although I may revisit the idea of becoming a morning person in the future, for now, I'm content to embrace the quiet stillness of the late night hours.


Despite promising myself in January that I would finally tackle the mountain of unread books piled high on my nightstand, a collection that had been steadily growing since last August, I found myself, in July, still scrolling through social media and binge-watching Netflix, the allure of instant gratification proving too strong to resist, and although I did manage to read a few books in February and March, they were mostly lighthearted romances and thrillers, a far cry from the dense literary tomes that loomed over me, their unread pages silently mocking my lack of intellectual curiosity, and while I occasionally picked up one of the more challenging books, I inevitably put it down after a few pages, my attention span too frayed to fully engage with the complex narratives, a symptom of my digitally-addled brain, and as the summer months passed, my reading goals receded further into the background, replaced by beach trips and barbecues, and by September, I had resigned myself to the fact that my New Year's resolution would remain unfulfilled, the pile of unread books a constant reminder of my unfulfilled aspirations, a testament to the seductive power of procrastination and the ever-present distractions of the digital age.
