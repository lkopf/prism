Pursuant to the provisions of Section 702 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S. Code § 230, which provides immunity from liability for providers and users of interactive computer services relating to third-party content, the defendant platform cannot be held liable for defamatory statements published by its users, except as otherwise provided by law, such as in cases involving intellectual property violations or federal criminal law, and this immunity is intended to promote the free flow of information and encourage the development of online platforms by shielding them from the potentially chilling effects of excessive litigation related to user-generated content, and while the defendant platform is encouraged to implement reasonable content moderation policies, it is not obligated to actively monitor or censor user-generated content, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Zeran v.

North Carolina, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), the Supreme Court recognized the internet as an essential forum for public discourse and the exchange of ideas, highlighting the importance of protecting online speech from undue government interference, and these cases, taken together, establish a framework for understanding Section 230 immunity and its role in safeguarding free speech online, while also recognizing the complex challenges inherent in regulating the vast and ever-evolving landscape of the internet.
