The dilapidated tavern, nestled deep within the shadowed alleys of 18th-century Prague, its flickering gas lamps casting an eerie glow on the cobblestone streets slick with a November drizzle, offered little respite from the biting wind that howled through the broken windowpanes, a wind that carried with it the whispered tales of alchemists and golem-makers, stories that chilled the very marrow of the lone traveler, a weary cartographer named Elias, who, having journeyed for months from the sun-drenched shores of the Aegean Sea, clutching a tattered map promising the location of a mythical city said to be built of pure gold, found himself shivering in the dimly lit corner, nursing a lukewarm mug of spiced wine and contemplating the veracity of the legends he'd chased across continents, his thoughts punctuated by the rhythmic creaking of the tavern sign swinging precariously above the entrance, a sign depicting a three-headed raven, a symbol that resonated with a disturbing familiarity, a symbol he'd seen etched onto ancient stones in forgotten temples hidden amidst the olive groves of Greece, and as the rain intensified, transforming the cobblestones into a shimmering river reflecting the distorted gaslight, Elias felt a growing unease, a sense of being watched, a feeling that intensified with each gust of wind that rattled the tavern door, as if the very city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something, or someone, to arrive.

Within the ancient walls of the Colosseum in Rome under the oppressive heat of August 1802, a lone poet, his brow furrowed in concentration, scribbled verses in his leather-bound journal, inspired by the grandeur of the crumbling ruins, the ghosts of gladiators and emperors whispering through the arches, the echoes of past glories resonating through the centuries, the weight of history pressing down on him, igniting his imagination, fueling his desire to capture the essence of this iconic monument in words, to immortalize its beauty and its tragedy, its triumph and its decay.
