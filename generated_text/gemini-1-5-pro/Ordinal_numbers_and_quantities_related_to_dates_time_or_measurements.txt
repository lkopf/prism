On the two hundred and fifty-sixth day of the year, precisely at eleven o'clock and thirty-seven minutes ante meridiem, after meticulously measuring one thousand four hundred and forty-seven millimeters of silk thread for the third tapestry restoration attempt, Lady Beatrice contemplated the fifty-two weeks remaining until the grand unveiling, anxiously calculating the sixty-four thousand eight hundred seconds that comprised each day, wondering if the fourth shipment of one hundred and twenty-eight spools of gold thread would arrive before the twenty-first of October, a date she had circled thrice on her calendar, knowing full well the second and third seamstresses were only capable of stitching seventy-five centimeters per hour while she, the first and most experienced, could complete two hundred and sixteen centimeters in the same timeframe, a discrepancy that threatened to delay the project beyond the two hundredth anniversary of the tapestry's creation, an event scheduled to be celebrated with three hundred and eighty-four guests, each requiring a place setting with exactly three forks, two knives, and six spoons, along with one hundred and ninety-two miniature pastries and fifty-seven bottles of imported champagne, a logistical nightmare that kept her awake for at least seventy-two minutes past midnight for the tenth night in a row.

Having spent the first four hours of the one hundred and eighty-second day of the year reviewing two hundred and thirty-five pages of the five hundred and twelve-page report on the projected three-point-seven percent increase in global tea consumption, Alistair realized that by the tenth of June, which was exactly seventy-seven days away, he needed to have compiled a comprehensive analysis of the top twenty-five tea-producing regions, factoring in the average rainfall of four hundred and thirty-two millimeters per annum, the average temperature of twenty-seven degrees Celsius during the peak harvest season, and the projected export volume of nine hundred and sixty-four metric tons of various tea varieties, including two hundred and fifty-six tons of black tea, one hundred and twenty-eight tons of green tea, and sixty-four tons of white tea, all while simultaneously preparing for the fifteenth annual Tea Connoisseurs' Conference scheduled for the second week of July, an event that required him to coordinate the tasting of eighty-seven different teas from twelve different countries, arrange accommodation for one hundred and forty-four attendees, and print three hundred and sixty brochures detailing the history and cultural significance of each tea, a task that seemed as daunting as climbing Mount Everest for the seventh time.
