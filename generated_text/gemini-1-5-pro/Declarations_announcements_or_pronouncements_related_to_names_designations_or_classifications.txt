We hereby declare, pronounce, and officially designate, with the utmost solemnity and in accordance with the ancient traditions and established protocols of this esteemed institution, the hitherto unnamed celestial body located at galactic coordinates X42-Y79-Z12, previously identified by the provisional designation Alpha Centauri Omega-7, and informally referred to as the "Wandering Star" by generations of amateur astronomers, to be henceforth and forevermore known and recognized as the "Star of Aethelred," in honor of the esteemed Professor Aethelred Quasar, whose groundbreaking research into the astrophysical properties of quasars, pulsars, and other celestial phenomena has revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos, his contributions to the field spanning decades of dedicated study, meticulous observation, and tireless analysis, culminating in the publication of his seminal work, "The Symphony of the Stars," which laid the foundation for the modern understanding of galactic evolution, a work that has inspired generations of astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists, and which continues to be a cornerstone of astrophysical education, its influence felt in classrooms and laboratories around the world, a testament to Professor Quasar's enduring legacy as a giant among the scientific community, his name now etched into the fabric of the heavens themselves, a fitting tribute to a life dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

By the power vested in me as the Supreme Grand Master of the Order of the Celestial Scribe, I, Zarthus the Illuminated, do hereby proclaim, pronounce, and declare, for all time and throughout the multiverse, that the newly discovered species of interdimensional cephalopod, exhibiting bioluminescent tentacles, telepathic communication abilities, and a remarkable aptitude for solving complex astrophysical equations, shall be henceforth designated and classified as Cephalopoda Stellaris Mathematicus, its name reflecting both its physical characteristics and its extraordinary cognitive capabilities, a designation that distinguishes it from all other known life forms in this or any other dimension, and which serves to highlight the profound implications of its discovery for our understanding of the evolution of intelligence in the cosmos, a discovery that challenges our preconceived notions about the nature of consciousness and the limits of biological possibility, prompting us to reconsider our place in the grand tapestry of existence, and to marvel at the infinite diversity and wonder of the universe we inhabit, a universe that continues to surprise and amaze us with its boundless creativity and its seemingly endless capacity to generate new and wondrous forms of life.

In accordance with the established procedures and regulations outlined in the Galactic Codex, Section 3, Subsection 7, Paragraph 12, we, the representatives of the Intergalactic Federation of Sentient Beings, do hereby officially declare, announce, and pronounce the reclassification of Planet Xylo-9, previously designated as a Class M planet, to a Class X planet, this reclassification being based on the recent discovery of a highly unstable and potentially hazardous energy source emanating from the planetâ€™s core, a discovery made by the exploratory vessel Starship Voyager during its recent survey of the outer rim of the Gamma Quadrant, the findings of which have been rigorously reviewed and verified by the Federation's scientific council, and deemed sufficiently compelling to warrant this change in classification, a change that will have significant implications for interstellar travel and trade routes within the affected sector, and which requires the immediate implementation of a quarantine zone around the planet, effective immediately, until such time as the nature and extent of the energy source can be fully assessed and deemed safe, a process that may take several years, if not decades, to complete.

With the full authority granted to me by the Council of Elders, I hereby pronounce and declare that the newly discovered valley nestled between the peaks of Mount Cinder and Mount Frost shall be named Whisperwind Valley, its designation inspired by the gentle breezes that perpetually caress its verdant slopes, whispering secrets of the ancient world to those who listen closely, a place of tranquility and natural beauty, untouched by the ravages of civilization, where the air is clean, the waters are pure, and the spirit of the land remains strong, a sanctuary for all who seek respite from the cares of the world, a place where one can reconnect with the primal forces of nature and find solace in the quiet embrace of the mountains, a place where the whispers of the wind carry tales of forgotten heroes and ancient prophecies, weaving a tapestry of magic and wonder that captivates the imagination and nourishes the soul.


Therefore, let it be known throughout the realm, by order of His Royal Majesty, King Oberon the Wise, that the newly hatched dragon, with scales the color of amethyst and eyes that burn with the fire of a thousand suns, shall be named Ignis Rex, the Fire King, its designation a testament to its majestic presence and the awe-inspiring power it wields, a power that will one day protect the kingdom from all who would threaten its peace and prosperity, a power that will ensure the continued reign of the royal lineage for generations to come, a symbol of strength and resilience, a beacon of hope in times of darkness, a guardian of the realm, the Fire King, Ignis Rex.

By the authority vested in me as the High Priestess of the Order of the Silver Moon, I hereby pronounce and declare that the child born under the auspicious alignment of the three moons shall be named Lunara, her designation signifying her connection to the celestial bodies that govern the tides of fate, a name that whispers of magic and mystery, a name that foretells a destiny intertwined with the ancient powers of the cosmos, a destiny that will shape the course of history and leave an indelible mark upon the tapestry of time.


Thus, by decree of the Grand Council of the United Planets, it is hereby declared and announced that the newly discovered element, exhibiting properties unlike any previously observed substance, shall be designated and classified as Element 120, provisionally named "Unbinilium," its existence confirming long-held theoretical predictions about the structure of matter and expanding our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe, a discovery that opens new frontiers in scientific exploration and holds the potential to revolutionize various fields, from energy production to materials science.


Therefore, let it be proclaimed throughout the land, by order of the Empress Celestia, that the newly constructed city, rising majestically from the ashes of the old, shall be henceforth known as Phoenixia, a name that symbolizes rebirth and renewal, a testament to the resilience and indomitable spirit of its people, a city destined for greatness, a beacon of hope for all who seek a new beginning.

We, the members of the International Astronomical Union, hereby declare, pronounce, and officially designate the newly discovered asteroid, previously identified by the provisional designation 2023 XY123, to be henceforth known as "Asteroid Kepler-186f," in honor of the groundbreaking discovery of the exoplanet Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable world located within the habitable zone of its star, a milestone in the search for extraterrestrial life.

Henceforth, by the power vested in me as the Supreme Commander of the Galactic Fleet, I hereby declare and pronounce that the newly commissioned starship, equipped with the latest advancements in warp drive technology and armed with state-of-the-art weaponry, shall be designated and christened the "Intrepid," a name that embodies its mission to boldly explore the uncharted territories of the galaxy, a symbol of our unwavering commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of civilization.
